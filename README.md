## ⬇️ Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.sgtswagrid" %% "not-enough-structures" % "0.1.0"
```

## 📢 Publishing workflow

GitHub releases are automatically published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/) upon creation, using [`sbt-dynver`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-dynver).

### Example

To release version `1.2.3`, go to **Releases → Draft a new release**, create the tag `v1.2.3`, and click **Publish release**.
Note the inclusion of `v` in the GitHub release name but not the resulting Maven version.
